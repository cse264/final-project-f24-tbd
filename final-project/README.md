User story/Use case:

The HyperSpace Library is an interactive reading list that allows users to browse books and track books theyâ€™ve read. The user will login as either basic or premium user. If the user is basic, they will be able to look up books, add it to their liked books, and comment on the book. If the user is premium, they can do the same thing but they will also be able to look at their recommendations tab that will give them additional books based on their liked books. 

Tech Stack: 

Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Google Books API, JWT for user authentication.
